## The Clojurians Zulip
 
Most of our communication takes place in specific streams at the [Clojurians Zulip chat](http://clojurians.zulipchat.com).

Small task groups often create ad-hoc streams for their task, but a lot of the communitcation takes place in more popular, long-living streams (examples below).

Most streams are public, some are private. Usually, streams are chosen to be private not for secrecy, but for focus, and for creating an atmosphere where people are comfortable talking, knowing who are listening.

This [original announcement](https://clojureverse.org/t/introducing-clojurians-zulip/3173) of the Clojurians Zulip by Gert Goet gives some context and explains why it makes sense for some parts of the Clojure community to move into Zulip. Scicloj followed that advice.

## Relevant active streams

Here are the main scicloj-related active streams, dedicated to certain subgroups, child communities or sister communities of scicloj:

- [#data-science](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/151924-data-science) - general data science topics

## Recommended practices

You may wish to learn a little bit about the concepts of [Zulip streams and topics](https://zulipchat.com/help/about-streams-and-topics). Note that all streams and topics (and even single messages) have URLs, that you can open at separate tabs in your browser.

When joining Zulip, it is a good idea to present yourself at the [#new-members / hello](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/150795-new-members/topic/hello.20.F0.9F.91.8B) topic, and in general, at topics called 'hello' or 'personal introductions' at specific streams you are subscribing to, mainly [this 'hello' topic at the #data-science stream](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/151924-data-science/topic/hello).

When reading the feed to cactch up, it is sometimes comfortable to browse through the [aggregate feed](http://clojurians.zulipchat.com) of all streams, or at the feed of a specific stream, such as [#data-science](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/151924-data-science).

When writing messages, it is recommended to be at the page of a specific topic, e.g. [#data-science / tech.ml.dataset](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/151924-data-science/topic/tech.2Eml.2Edataset). That would prevent some very common mistake, of writing under the wrong topic.

You may wish to configure the [streams-notifications](https://zulipchat.com/help/stream-notifications) behaviours to your taste.

To discover conversations relevant to you, you may [browse and subscribe to streams](https://zulipchat.com/help/browse-and-subscribe-to-streams). To see the feed of all public streams, including those you are not subscribed to, you can look at [this URL](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/streams/public/-stream/slack-archive) (note that we are filtering out the huge [#slack-archive](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/180378-slack-archive) stream).
