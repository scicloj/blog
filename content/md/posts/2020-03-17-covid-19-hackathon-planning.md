The scicloj community is organizing an online hackathon for studying COVID-19 data.

**Please mark your preferred dates for the hackathon [here](https://doodle.com/poll/8imu9dyqmftygihs) (yes/no/if-need-be).**

During one day, we will study together the COVID-19 story, using global and local data, in Clojure.

We have several goals in mind:
- learn about the pandemic
- try out the emerging Clojure data science stack
- bring the community together

Towards the meeting we will discuss possible topics and data sources at the [#covid-19 stream](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/227504-covid-19) of the Clojurians Zulip.

See the Q&A below for some more details.


Wishes for good health and better times! -- the scicloj organizing team


## Q&A

Q: What background is assumed?

A: We'll assume that you feel comfortable with reading and writing Clojure.

Q: I like Clojure, but want to use it combined with additional tools and languages. Is that OK?

A: Sure, that would be great.

Q: Do you assume any additional scientific background?

A: No prior background in science, probability or statistics is required. We want the hackathon to be accessible to all who participate, and welcome questions that help explain the data, and how we can understand it.

Q: I can only attend for a few hours. Is it ok?

A: Yes.

Q: I have a friend who is curious about studying these data and does not know Clojure. Can I invite my friend?

A: It would be great to invite your friend, as long as you find a way to collaborate (e.g., connect your Clojure code to their work; do some pair-coding; or just involve them in the thinking and theoretical analysis).
