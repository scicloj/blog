A lot is happening in the Clojure data science ecosystem. While the infrastructure and tooling are gradually maturing, new libraries and experiments are rising. It seems that we are on a phase transition, and some beautiful things are about to happen.

It is a good time to meet and catch up, hear about active projects and discuss future directions and ways to collaborate.

That is what we will be doing in the [public meeting](https://twitter.com/scicloj/status/1291845872884625408) on the coming Sunday, August 30th 2020.

## Time
We will meet at 5pm UTC, for 90m minutes. Please check your time difference from [the UTC timezone](https://time.is/UTC).

The next public meeting is planned to take on a different hour, more comfortable to the friends in East Asia.
