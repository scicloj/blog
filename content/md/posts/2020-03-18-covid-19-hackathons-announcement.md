Following [yesterday's post](../2020-03-17-covid-19-hackathon-planning/) suggesting a COVID-19 online hackathon, we got some of reactions at [the mail group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/clojure/EvRVhMiPtPg), [the subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Clojure/comments/fkcf5w/online_clojure_covid19_hackathon/), the [date poll](https://doodle.com/poll/8imu9dyqmftygihs), and mainly the relevant Zulip [chat streams](../../pages/chat_streams/#relevant_active_streams).

## Two hackathons
Seeing that broad interest, we decided to set **two** dates for online hackathons:
* Saturday, March 21st (yes, very close)
* Sunday, Match 29th

The hackathons are not intended to contain all our activity in this area. Before and after them, we will discuss the topic at the [#covid-19 stream](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/227504-covid-19) of the Clojurians Zulip. 

## Joining

To attend the Hackathons, we ask you to present yourself under the [#covid-19 / hello](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/227504-covid-19/topic/hello) topic, tell which hackathon(s) you wish to attend, and follow the announcements under the [#covid-19 / announcements](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/227504-covid-19/topic/announcements) topic.

If you wish to be involved in organizing, moderating, assisting others or influencing the agenda, it would be great to mention that when presenting yourself.

If you have any doubts regarding participaction, have a look at the Q&A on [yesterday's post](../2020-03-17-covid-19-hackathon-planning/), or please ask under the [#covid-19 / hackathon q&a](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/227504-covid-19/topic/hackathon.20q.26a) topic.
 
## Rough plan

~~The Hackathons will begin in the European morning, and end in the American afternoon.~~ 

~~At some points through the day, we will have video meetings of 30-60 minutes, but most of the activity will take place in text chat.~~

**Update: Both hackathons will begin at 2pm UTC, and last 4 hours. Some parts of the meeting will be in video, and some other parts -- in text chat.**

We will split into teams, and each team will discuss things among itself, and sometimes with everybody, through the chat.

For more details, please follow the [#covid-19 / announcements](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/227504-covid-19/topic/announcements) topic.



See you there, and be safe -- the scicloj organizing team
